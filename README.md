Jarvis - My Home Assistant Voice Wake Word Name (instead of using "Alexa, <command>" or "Hey Google, <command>").  This name is configurable if you train a custom name, or one of the other pre-populated names already trained. 

This is my project to host my current status of my Home Assistant WAKE WORD Speaker/Microphone to control Home Assistant locally and get rid of Google Home/Amazon Alexa devices.  Home Assistant does the processing of the voice information.  If you are a NabuCasa subscriber, you can offload the voice processing to NabuCasa servers.  

NOTE: If you are running Home Assistant on low powered hardware, i.e. Raspberri Pi or low CPU/RAM performance, the voice data processing can be extremely slow...  As it learns your voice and words, it will get faster, but on lower powered devices, its better to use cloud voice processing with NabuCasa.
